#  ----------
#
#  Categories are a way of grouping quests.
#  When a player uses /quests, a menu of categories will be presented to them.
#  When a player clicks on a category, a list of quests under that category will show.
#  If categories are disabled, all quests will be shown under one big GUI.
#  Players can access specific categories by command using /quests c [category].
#  If a quest does not have a category, it will not be shown.
